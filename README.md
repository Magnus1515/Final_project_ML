# Book Recommender System by Features

The present work describes a simplification of current recommendation systems applied to the field of books. It addresses the objectives to be met to achieve the purpose of recommending books based on user consumption.

## Description
In the project we create a book recommender system using python and supervised learing as model.

## Usage 
The problem arises from the need for a user to obtain precise recommendations of books they may be interested in renting based on their rental history. Currently, at the Luis Fimbres Moreno Library of CETYS University Campus Tijuana, despite having a wide catalog of books to choose from, there is no recommendation system that allows the user to discover more books that match their interests. As a solution, it is proposed to design and implement a recommendation system based on the knowledge of the individual characteristics of the books.
